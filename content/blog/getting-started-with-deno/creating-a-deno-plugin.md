This post is part of an article series where we explore multiple Deno features. This is the 3rd post, but previously we wrote about:

- Creating a CLI with Deno
- Using puppeteer with Deno

Today we're here to explore a specific feature: Deno plugins. If you haven't heard of them, Deno plugins enable users to write code in Rust that can be called from JavaScript. This communication is made by using message passing of Buffers (more on this later).

The main reason we're here exploring this is because we believe that this interconnection JS <> Rust unlocks a great amount of potential.

This will be a very hands-on blogpost. You shouldn't need to follow or code it by itself, but you can do it.

We'll create a Deno plugin. To make its scope short enough, we decided to create an image-manipulation plugin with one single feature: **transform an image to grayscale**.

As we develop this plugin and understand the features of Deno, we'll also explain some of the concepts we learned, so that you don't have to do it. Get on board!

<!-- TODO: mention unstable -->

If you want to follow by looking at the code, [here you have it]().

## Hello world

Yeah, here we are, the good old hello world. As the main goal of plugins is to enable us to write Rust code in a JavaScript codebase, that's where we started.

This is how the hello_world function looks like in a Deno plugin.

```rs
use deno_core::plugin_api::Interface;
use deno_core::plugin_api::Op;
use deno_core::plugin_api::ZeroCopyBuf;

fn hello_world(
  _interface: &mut dyn Interface,
  _zero_copy: &mut [ZeroCopyBuf],
) -> Op {
  println!("Rust: Hello from rust.");

  Op::Sync(Box::new([]))
}
```

For now let's ignore the parameters this function receives and the value it returns. What matters here is that this function is printing a message to the console.

After having the hello_world function, and for Deno to recognize what functions are available to be called from Rust, we need to register this operation by using one specific Deno's core API - `register_op`.

```rs
use deno_core::plugin_api::Interface;
use deno_core::plugin_api::Op;
use deno_core::plugin_api::ZeroCopyBuf;

#[no_mangle]
pub fn deno_plugin_init(interface: &mut dyn Interface) {
  interface.register_op("helloWorld", hello_world);
}

fn hello_world(
  _interface: &mut dyn Interface,
  _zero_copy: &mut [ZeroCopyBuf],
) -> Op {
  println!("Rust: Hello from rust.");

  Op::Sync(Box::new([]))
}
```

<!-- TODO: mention no_mangle? -->

Operation registered, we should now be able to call it from our JavaScript code. Deno's plugin API doesn't allow to directly call a function, but instead we must dispatch a message that will do it for us.

```js
const rustPluginId = Deno.openPlugin(`./rust-plugin/${rustLibFilename}`);

const { helloWorld } = Deno.core.ops();

function runHelloWorld() {
  Deno.core.dispatch(helloWorld);
}

runHelloWorld();
```

That's all we need to get the hello_world function we wrote on Rust to be called. Some things are happening here, let me explain it before we execute this.

- Loading the plugin by calling `Deno.openPlugin` with the path for the compiled Rust artifact.

*Gotcha*: Rust artifact's file extension changes depending on the Operative System. We create a function called `resolveRustLibFilename` that handles it [here](https://github.com/NMFR/deno-image-transform/blob/add-rust-plugin/main.js#L9).

- Getting the operation identifier from `Deno.core.ops` with the same name we registered on Rust

- Dispatching a message with the operation identifier (`helloWorld`) to run it

If we execute the following code, this is what we get:

```
$ deno run --unstable --allow-plugin main.ts

ADD OUTPUT HERE
```

And that's it, hello world is done! Pursuing our goal of creating a function that transforms an image into grayscale, the next step is to be able to send parameters into the plugin code, written in Rust. That's what we'll do next.

## Sending parameters

We previously noticed that Deno operation functions are called with two parameters:

```rs
fn hello_world(
  _interface: &mut dyn Interface,
  _zero_copy: &mut [ZeroCopyBuf],
) -> Op {
```

The first parameter, `_interface`, is the same interface made available in the `deno_plugin_init` function, the one that allows us to register new operations.

The second one, `_zero_copy` is what interests us more here. It's a `ZeroCopyBuffer` from JavaScript. Deno plugin API mandates that all communications are made using buffers, and the `_zero_copy` buffer is where the parameters sent from JavaScript will live.

As you might have guessed by now, if we're sending Buffers but we want to send text, we will need to do some encoding and decoding before we send these messages, as the following JavaScript snippet shows.

```js
const rustPluginId = Deno.openPlugin(`./rust-plugin/${rustLibFilename}`);
const { testTextParamsAndReturn } = Deno.core.ops();

function runTestTextParamsAndReturn() {
  const textEncoder = new TextEncoder();
  const param0 = textEncoder.encode("text");
  const param1 = textEncoder.encode("sent from");
  const param2 = textEncoder.encode("deno");

  const response = Deno.core.dispatch(
    testTextParamsAndReturn,
    param0,
    param1,
    param2
  );

  const textDecoder = new TextDecoder();
  const result = textDecoder.decode(response);
  console.log(`Deno: result: ${result}`);
}

runTestTextParamsAndReturn();
```

We're using the globals `TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder` to encode the text "test sent from deno" that will be sent as 3 different paramters to `Deno.core.dispatch`. Then we're decoding the message we get from Rust, and printing it to the console.

To get this message printed on the console from Rust, this is what we'll have to do:

```rs
pub fn deno_plugin_init(interface: &mut dyn Interface) {
  interface.register_op("testTextParamsAndReturn", op_test_text_params_and_return);
}

fn op_test_text_params_and_return(
  _interface: &mut dyn Interface,
  zero_copy: &mut [ZeroCopyBuf],
) -> Op {
  for (idx, buf) in zero_copy.iter().enumerate() {
    let param_str = std::str::from_utf8(&buf[..]).unwrap();

    println!("Rust: param[{}]: {}", idx, param_str);
  }

  let result = b"result from rust";
  Op::Sync(Box::new(*result))
}
```

You can see that we're converting the buffers coming from JS into text and printing it. Then we're returning `Op:Sync`, this method is the way for plugins to send messages back into the JavaScript code.

The final result of executing this is the following:

```bash
$ deno run --unstable --allow-plugin main.js

ADD OUTPUT
```

As we can see, we get the params sent printed by the Rust code, and the response from Rust code printed using JavaScript, the communication is working!

The next step towards getting this image to grayscale plugin to work, is to be able to send the image metadata to the plugin. Since JSON is the native format on JavaScript, that's what we'll use.

## Sending JSON parameters

Our objective here is to send a JSON object with some specificites about the image to the plugin code. We already know that the communication is done using Buffers, and thus we'll need to convert this JSON object into a Buffer (`Uint8Array`), this is what the JavaScript code looks like.

```js
const rustPluginId = Deno.openPlugin(`./rust-plugin/${rustLibFilename}`);
const { testJsonParamsAndReturn } = Deno.core.ops();

function runTestJsonParamsAndReturn() {
  const textEncoder = new TextEncoder();
  const image = {
    hasAlphaChannel: true,
    size: {
      width: 100,
      height: 50,
    },
  };

  const imageMetadata = textEncoder.encode(JSON.stringify(image));
  const response = Deno.core.dispatch(testJsonParamsAndReturn, imageMetadata);

  const textDecoder = new TextDecoder();
  const result = textDecoder.decode(response);
  console.log(`Deno: result: ${result}`);
  const jsonResult = JSON.parse(result);
  console.log(`Deno: jsonResult.success: ${jsonResult.success}`);
}

runTestJsonParamsAndReturn();
```

Note how we have to covert back and forth from JSON into Buffer and vice-versa. We're also logging these values to the console so that it's clear what's happening when we execute the code.

Parameters sent from JS, we now need to get this image metadata on Rust, and this is how it looks like:

 ```rs
use deno_core::plugin_api::Interface;
use deno_core::plugin_api::Op;
use deno_core::plugin_api::ZeroCopyBuf;
use deno_core::serde_json;

 fn op_test_json_params_and_return(
  _interface: &mut dyn Interface,
  zero_copy: &mut [ZeroCopyBuf],
) -> Op {
  let image_metadata = &zero_copy[0];
  let json: serde_json::Value = serde_json::from_slice(image_metadata).unwrap();
  let has_alpha_channel: bool = match &json[("hasAlphaChannel")] {
    serde_json::Value::Bool(b) => *b,
    _ => true,
  };
  let width = match &json["size"]["width"] {
    serde_json::Value::Number(n) => n.as_u64().unwrap_or(0),
    _ => 0,
  };
  let height = match &json["size"]["height"] {
    serde_json::Value::Number(n) => n.as_u64().unwrap_or(0),
    _ => 0,
  };

  println!("Rust: json param: {}", json);
  println!("Rust: has_alpha_channel: {}", has_alpha_channel);
  println!("Rust: width: {}", width);
  println!("Rust: height: {}", height);

  let result = serde_json::json!({
    "success": true
  });
  Op::Sync(serde_json::to_vec(&result).unwrap().into_boxed_slice())
}
```

Our previous knowledge tells us that `_zero_copy` contains the paramters sent from JS, and thus we're getting the first, which is the image metadata Buffer.

We're decoding this buffer using `serde_json`, made available by the Deno core. This function decodes JSON parameters into a dicionary object, which we called `json` here.

Then, we're logging the paramters, and sending a JSON object back to JavaScript indicating that the function run successfully.

We can now run this code and check the result:

```bash
$ deno run --unstable --allow-plugin main.js

OUTPUT
```

We can see that the parameters are being printed from Rust, and that the success message sent from the plugin is reaching the JS code. We're getting there! The next step is to send the image to grayscale into the plugin.

## Sending the image to the plugin

We're getting closer and closer to our final goal. Until now we managed to get the communication working between the plugin and the JavaScript code. We also managed to send a JSON with important metadata information.

We now know that somehow we'll be able to send the metadata and the image into the plugin. Having the image, it's the plugins' job to convert it into grayscale, as the next code snippet does.

```rs
const RGB_PIXEL_SIZE: usize = 3;
const RGBA_PIXEL_SIZE: usize = 4;

#[no_mangle]
pub fn deno_plugin_init(interface: &mut dyn Interface) {
  interface.register_op("toGreyScale", op_to_grey_scale);
}

fn op_to_grey_scale(
  _interface: &mut dyn Interface,
  zero_copy: &mut [ZeroCopyBuf],
) -> Op {
  let image_metadata = &zero_copy[0];
  let json: serde_json::Value = serde_json::from_slice(image_metadata).unwrap();
  let has_alpha_channel: bool = match &json[("hasAlphaChannel")] {
    serde_json::Value::Bool(b) => *b,
    _ => true,
  };
  let pixel_size = if has_alpha_channel { RGBA_PIXEL_SIZE } else { RGB_PIXEL_SIZE };
  let image = &mut zero_copy[1];
  let image_array: &mut[u8] = image.as_mut();

  println!("Rust: sleeping for 2000 ms (simulating a >2000 ms execution time)");
  std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(2));

  to_grey_scale(image_array, pixel_size);

  println!("Rust: to_grey_scale() finished");

  Op::Sync(Box::new([]))
}
```

Once again we're decoding the image metadata and getting its parameters. Then we're checking what's the pixel size based on that (images with alpha channel have a pixel size of 4, while images without transparency have a pixel size of 3).

You might have noticed that we're running `std::thread::sleep` method inside this function. We're using this to simulate a CPU heavy task that will take more than 2 seconds. You can ignore this for now, as we'll come back later to explain why we want this there.

The conversion into grayscale is then delegated to another function, `to_grey_scale`, which contains the following code:

```rs
fn to_grey_scale(image_array: &mut[u8], pixel_size: usize) {
  let image_array_length = image_array.len() - (image_array.len() % pixel_size);

  for i in (0..image_array_length).step_by(pixel_size) {
    let pixel_average = (((image_array[i] as u16) + (image_array[i + 1] as u16) + (image_array[i + 2] as u16)) / 3) as u8;
    image_array[i] = pixel_average;
    image_array[i + 1] = pixel_average;
    image_array[i + 2] = pixel_average;
  }
}
```

*Note*: Converting an image to grayscale is just setting the values of the red, green, and blue pixesl to an average of all of them.

<!-- TODO: better explanation -->

What we'll do now is to load the image from the filesystem using Deno APIs, and sending it's decoded content into Rust, then letting it do its magic.

The JavaScript code that does this is quite simple:

```js
import { decode, encode } from "https://deno.land/x/jpegts@1.1/mod.ts";

const rustPluginId = Deno.openPlugin(`./rust-plugin/${rustLibFilename}`);
const {
  toGreyScale,
} = Deno.core.ops();

async function runToGreyScale(inputFilename, outputFilename) {
  let raw = await Deno.readFile(`images/${inputFilename}`);
  const image = decode(raw);
  const textEncoder = new TextEncoder();
  const imageDescriptor = {
    hasAlphaChannel: true,
    size: {
      width: image.width,
      height: image.height,
    },
  };
  const imageMetadata = textEncoder.encode(JSON.stringify(imageDescriptor));
  const decodedImage = image.data;

  Deno.core.dispatch(toGreyScale, imageMetadata, decodedImage);

  raw = encode(image, 100);

  await Deno.writeFile(`images/output/${outputFilename}`, raw.data);

  console.log(
    `Deno: runToGreyScale(\"images/${inputFilename}\") > "images/output/${outputFilename}"`
  );
}

await runToGreyScale("dice.jpg", "dice.jpg");
```

We're using a third-party library named `jpegjs` to decode the image from JPEG into a buffer. That buffer is then sent to the plugin. After the plugin returns, all we do is writing its result into a file.

The plugin code that will handle this `toGreyScale` from the plugin side is the following:

If we execute the following code with a random image, this is the result we get.

```bash
$ deno run --unstable --allow-plugin --allow-read

OUTPUT
```

**Before**

![image-before]()

**After**

![image-after]()

And it is working!

One thing you might have noticed that we're not getting the return value from Rust after calling `Deno.core.dispatch`. However, our final code works. This is quite a strange behaviour, let me tell you why it happened:

In the above snippet we're using the same exact `image` variable that before contained the image in colors to save to the filesystem, and its working, but why?

We previously mentioned that the `ZeroCopyBuffer` sent into the plugins is a reference to the buffer sent from JS. This means that if this same buffer is modified (as it was by Rust's code), these changes directly reflect on the JavaScript side. That's what happened here.

Even though we got it working, this behaviour might be a little unintuitive. We'll fix it later in this blogpost.

It might seem like our final objective is achieved. Not so fast 😄. Remember that `std::tread::sleep` that we said we'd be back to? That's what we're doing now

One of the reasons we want to delegate CPU heavy tasks like image manipulation to a plugin is because of performance. We know that these logics will run much faster in Rust, enabling us to keep executing JavaScript code as the task is being executed in the background.

Our code might have worked, but it might not be using this *asychronosity* as it should.

Let's do a test and add a couple of console logs to a function that calls `toGreyScale` so that we get a better understanding of the execution order.

```js
const sleep = (milliseconds) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, milliseconds));
};

async function runToGreyScaleHangTest() {
  const toGreyScalePromise = runToGreyScale("dice.jpg", "hang-dice.jpg");

  console.log(
    "Deno: runToGreyScale() started, will try to do other stuff meanwhile"
  );

  for (let i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
    console.log(
      "Deno: sleeping for 200 ms (pretending to do something in parallel of runToGreyScale())"
    );
    await sleep(200);
  }

  await toGreyScalePromise;
}

await runToGreyScaleHangTest();
```

Note how we're firing the `runToGreyScale` execution but only awaiting on its execution at the end of the function with `await runToGreyScaleHangTest()`. If you are familiar with JavaScript, and assuming that our `runToGreyScale` function is asynchronous, the code inside the for loop should run before `runToGreyScale` finishes, right?

Well... Let's check.


```bash
$ deno run

OUTPUT
```

It doesn't seem like it, the function is triggered to start on the plugin, but then it *stops the world* and nothing is executed as the Rust code is doing its processing (and waiting for 2 full seconds).

This isn't the behaviour we want. One of the advantages of JavaScript asynchronicity is that it allows other code to be executed while heavy processing tasks are happening. The next section we'll explain how can we solve this problem.

## Fully leveraging asynchronicity
